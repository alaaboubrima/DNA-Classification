# DNA-Classification
This is a ML model which does a classification and a prediction for DNA sequences. 
The classification part is mainly used to identify the similarity ratio between human and other species (dogs for example). While the prediction part is to predict the gene family of a given sequence.
This model has an accuracy of 99.5%.
